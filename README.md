## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional working environment

* I built this app using designs I created with Figma: (Link to the designs)[https://www.figma.com/file/fRRcaBBNtog4134UGnujhQ/Cinema-World?node-id=0%3A1]  
* I used feature branches and pull requests
* I followed tasks on this Kanban board

## How to navigate this project
* `components` folder contains the code for each component.
* `pages` folder contains the code for each page.
* `public` folder contains the images I used for this project.
* `styles` folder contains the styling for each page and component.
* `tests` folder contains all the tests I wrote for this project.

## Why I built this project this way
* NextJS helps me build React applications safer and faster
* Using CSS modules helps me avoid naming clashes between different CSS classes.
* I used a REST API for this project because I realized that working with REST APIs is an essential part of the job of a frontend developer.
* I also wrote tests for the essential components of this project.

## If I had more time I would change this
* I would improve the design of the movie details page 
* I would add a feature for TV shows

## Available Scripts
* `npm run dev` - To start development server.
* `npm run start` - To start app in production mode.
* `npm run tests` - To run tests
